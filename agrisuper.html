                        parameter soil test service to the farmers on their mobile phones on live data basis. The
                        service of Agri Super App has been started on the basis of deficiency of nutrients in the soil.
                        The first will be based on testing the five important nutrients found in the soil through
                        sensors and making them immediately to the farmers through the app in the mobile phones
                        available with them. As we all know that if there is a lack of nutrients in the soil then the
                        plant can never be healthy resulting in reduction in yield and increase in cost. Agri Super App
                        will work to reduce this problem.<br>
                        Through this emphasis will be laid on making available information to the farmers in minutes
                        about how much nutrients to use with proper quantity as per the requirement.
                        <strong> E Agri Super</strong> App if there is any problem of crop then they will insist on
                        providing immediate
                        solution of the problem through advice. E Agri Super App emphasizes to the farmers of the state
                        to test the five essential nutrients of the soil from their fields and give immediate results.
                        This idea makes E -Agri Super better than other Agri platforms.

                            Why pH is important for soil and crop?

                    <p class="about_para2">pH is an important factor in crop growth and development because it affects the
                        availability of essential plant nutrients. pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a
                        solution, and it is typically measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Soils with a
                        pH less than 7 are considered acidic, and soils with a pH greater than 7 are considered
                        alkaline.
                        Different crops have different pH requirements, and the pH of the soil can affect the
                        availability of certain nutrients. For example, in acidic soils (pH less than 7), aluminum and
                        manganese can become more soluble, leading to toxicity and poor growth. In alkaline soils (pH
                        greater than 7), iron and zinc can become less soluble, leading to deficiencies and poor growth.
                        Additionally, the pH of the soil can affect the activity of microorganisms, which play an
                        important role in nutrient cycling.

                        potassium, is also affected by pH. In acidic soils, the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus,
                        and potassium can be decreased. Conversely, in alkaline soils, the availability of these
                        nutrients can be increased. Additionally, pH can affect the availability of micronutrients, such
                        as boron, copper, and zinc. In acidic soils, these micronutrients can become more available,
                        while in alkaline soils, they can become less available.
                        pH can also affect the absorption of water and oxygen by plant roots. In acidic soils, the
                        absorption of water and oxygen can be reduced, leading to poor growth and development. Alkaline
                        soils, on the other hand, can lead to an excess of water and oxygen in the root zone, which can
                        also lead to poor growth and development.
                        <br>
                        pH can also affect the activity of certain enzymes and hormones in plants. For example, enzymes
                        involved in the uptake and utilization of nutrients are sensitive to pH, and their activity can
                        be affected by changes in pH. Hormones, such as auxins, are also sensitive to pH, and their
                        activity can be affected by changes in pH.
                        <br>

                        For all these reasons, it's very important to test the pH of the soil before planting, and make
                        adjustments as necessary. This can be done by collecting soil samples and sending them to a
                        laboratory for analysis. There are also at-home kits available for testing soil pH. Once the pH
                        has been determined, adjustments can be made by adding lime to raise the pH of acidic soils or
                        sulfur to lower the pH of alkaline soils. Additionally, it's important to monitor the pH of the
                        soil throughout the growing season, and make adjustments as necessary.

                        affects the
                        availability of essential plant nutrients, the absorption of water and oxygen, the activity of
                        enzymes and hormones, and the susceptibility of crops to disease and pests. Therefore, it's
                        important to test the pH of the soil before planting and make adjustments as necessary, as well
                        as monitoring the pH throughout the growing season. By maintaining the appropriate pH for a
                        particular crop, growers can improve crop yields and reduce the risk of disease and pest damage.

                        can grow well in soils with lower nitrogen levels. These crops are often referred to as
                        "nitrogen-efficient" or "nitrogen-use efficient" crops.
                        One example of such crops are the legumes. Legumes, such as beans, lentils, peas and alfalfa,
                        have the ability to fix their own nitrogen from the air through a symbiotic relationship with
                        nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
                        <br> This means that they don't need as much nitrogen from the soil in order to grow, and can
                        even improve the soil nitrogen levels for other crops.
                        Cereals are also relatively low nitrogen demanding. Oat and barley are cereal crops which have a
                        lower Nitrogen requirement than other cereal crops such as corn, rice and wheat. These are
                        relatively low input crop, meaning they don’t need as much  fertilizer,water, and other inputs
                        to grow, making them well suited to sustainable and organic farming systems.
                        Other crops such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are also known to be relatively low in
                        nitrogen requirements, and can be grown in soil with low nitrogen levels.Root vegetables like
                        carrots, radishes and  turnips are also relatively

                        low nitrogen demanding and can grow well in
                        low nitrogen soils.
                        kale crops such as cabbage, broccooli, Cauliflower, considered in Kale crops.
                        <br> Another approach for low nitrogen management is crop rotation. by rotating crops, farmers
                        can take advantage of the different nitrogen requirements of different crops. For example, a
                        farmer might plant a nitrogen-fixing crop, in one field one year, and then rotate to a cereal
                        crop, such as oats, the next year. This can help to balance the overall nitrogen levels in the
                        soil, ensuring that there is enough nitrogen for all crops, while also reducing the need for
                        nitrogen-based fertilizers.

                        <br> Other cultivation practices such as using cover crops, reduced tillage, and intercropping
                        can also help to improve soil health and reduce the need for added nitrogen. Cover crops such as
                        legumes can fix nitrogen in the soil, while reduced tillage and intercropping can help to
                        increase the amount of organic matter in the soil, which can help to support the growth of
                        nitrogen-efficient crops.
                        <br>It is important to note that while these crops may have less Nitrogen requirements, other
                        essential nutrient like Phosphorous, Potassium, Micro-nutrients etc are still important for
                        their healthy growth. Also Soil conditions, weather and other factors may change crop behavior
                        and yield and also that it is important to check soil test to understand how much of each
                        nutrient is present and fertilize accordingly.
                        <br> In conclusion, there are many crops that can be grown in soils with low nitrogen levels.
                        Legumes, cereals, leafy greens, root vegetables, and other nitrogen-efficient crops can all be
                        grown in low nitrogen soils. Additionally, by using crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage,
                        and intercropping, farmers can help to improve the overall health of the soil and reduce the
                        need for added nitrogen.
